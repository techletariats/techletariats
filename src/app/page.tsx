            Techletariats is a collective of technologists, creators, and
            community members using our skills for the common good. We teach
            practical technical skills, provide free digital support to mutual
            aid organizations, and take on paid projects that help sustain our
            mission. Whether you’re learning, contributing, or collaborating,
            Techletariats is a space where technology and mutual aid work hand
            in hand to build collective power and shared understanding.

          <h2>Building Collective Power Through Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Technology has the power to connect people, share knowledge, and
            strengthen communities — but too often, it’s used to divide or
            exploit. Techletariats was founded to change that. We believe
            technical skills should serve the people, not profit. Our mission is
            to make technology accessible, collaborative, and rooted in mutual
            aid. By teaching, creating, and organizing together, we build tools
            that uplift our communities and empower individuals to take part in
            shaping a more equitable future.

          <h2>Grow Your Technical Skills While Strengthening Community</h2>
          <p>
            Learning technical skills shouldn’t require thousands of dollars or
            years of gatekeeping. At Techletariats, we provide guidance,
            mentorship, and real-world experience through community-driven
            projects. Instead of simulated bootcamp exercises, contributors work
            directly on meaningful tools and digital resources for mutual aid
            organizations. Whether you’re new to tech or refining your craft,
            you’ll gain practical experience, collaborate with others, and see
            your work make a tangible difference in the community.

          <h2>Free Technical Support for People-Powered Organizations</h2>
          <p>
            Mutual aid groups do essential work — feeding communities, offering
            shelter, organizing care — but many lack access to reliable digital
            tools. Techletariats partners with these organizations to provide
            free support in web development, design, video, and other technical
            needs. Our contributors gain hands-on experience while helping
            grassroots groups build stronger, more connected networks. We
            believe technology should serve collective liberation, not corporate
            interests — and that starts with empowering the people already doing
            the work.

          <h2>Ethical Tech Work That Supports the Collective</h2>
          <p>
            We also take on paid projects for small businesses, cooperatives,
            and organizations that share our values. When you
            hire Techletariats, you’re not just funding a service — you’re
            supporting a collective that reinvests its resources into community
            projects and mutual aid work. Our approach is transparent,
            collaborative, and grounded in ethics over profit. Every project we
            take on helps sustain free technical support for people-powered
            movements, building a cycle of shared benefit and collective growth.
